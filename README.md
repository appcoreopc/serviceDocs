# serviceDocs

As microservice gets more granular and often distributed across repository,  this project attempts to allow users to configure, pull, index and search throug code and documentation. 

It is a very time consuming task to clone and search through all the file. Things gets complicated when you have multiple branches. 
This makes developer task easier.
